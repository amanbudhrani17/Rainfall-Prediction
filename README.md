# Third Year Project

## Title: Weather Forecasting and Prediction

This is my fifth semester group project on Rainfall Prediction. We have build four model Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neral Network and Decision Tree.

### Software Used:

- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries:

- keras
- geopy
- urllib
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## API:

- NASA Power LARC API to fetch the weather data.

## How to run:

- Download the code, You need nothing else.
- Make sure you have active network, for the NASA Power LARC API to fetch weather data.
- Open the RFmodel.ipynb in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Enter the starting date, ending date and location.
- You will get the accuracy of the model.
- You can also type the previous day parameters to get 24 Hour predicted value.

## Hope you like the project !ðŸ˜Š
